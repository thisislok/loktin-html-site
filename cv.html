        <p>I’m passionate about bachata dancing and kung fu sparring—both activities that challenge my ability to think quickly and adapt in fast-paced, high-pressure situations. Whether in teamwork or competition, I learn how to read subtle cues from others and react decisively, while also training myself to stay calm and regain control when situations take a surprising turn. These practices sharpen my analytical skills and train my mind to stay focused under pressure.</p>
